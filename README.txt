This program is written in C and reads a set of words from a user specified dictionary file into a dynamically allocated array.
Using a breadth-first search, the smallest possible word ladder made from user specified start and end words is formed into a linked list
of strings, called type WordNode. Dictionary.txt contains "Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, Second Edition.", which contains over 120,000 words.
simple3.txt, simple4.txt, and simple5.txt contain a small sample of 3 letter, 4 letter, and 5 letter words respectively. Various other text files 
are also present to form random word ladders using make commands. The test subfolder contains a test.c application in which each function 
is tested individually from WordLadder.c, which is an implementation file of main.c.
